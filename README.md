# Templates Repository

This is a collection of templates for popular tech stacks, designed to save you time and help you get started with coding faster. We've got templates for everything from Vue and React to Node and Express, all pre-configured with the libraries and frameworks you need to hit the ground running.

## Usage

To use one of our templates, simply clone the repository and specify the template you want to use. For example, to clone our Vue + Tailwind + TypeScript + Vuex template, run the following command:

`degit samyon196/templates/vue-tailwind-ts-store`


This will create a new directory with the template files in it, ready for you to start coding.

## Naming Convention

We follow a naming convention to make it easy to find the template you need. Each template name includes the following elements:

- Primary technology or stack being used (e.g. "vue", "react", "angular", "node")
- Additional libraries or frameworks being used (e.g. "tailwind", "bootstrap", "express", "next", "nuxt")
- Additional features or functionality being provided (e.g. "auth", "store", "router", "i18n", "graphql")
- Programming language being used (e.g. "js", "ts")

Using this convention, you can easily identify the right template for your needs and get started coding right away!
